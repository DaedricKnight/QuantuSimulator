/**
 * The Pauli-Z gate acts on a single qubit.
 * It equates to a rotation around the Z-axis of the Bloch sphere by Ï€ radians.
 * Thus, it is a special case of a phase shift gate (which are described in a next subsection) with
 * \phi =\pi . It leaves the basis state |0> unchanged and maps |1> to -|1>.
